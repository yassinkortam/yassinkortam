I'm a rising Junior at UCLA studying electrical engineering and premed. 

I'm currently working on creating a web-based platform for MSAs, and perhaps other student organizations, to reach new and current students more effectively.  

I am also working to find ways to apply data science and machine learning to the medical field.
